# HATCH & SNATCH — Roblox game (read this first)

Roblox creature game: hatch eggs from a conveyor, grow creatures from baby to
adult, earn cash, and steal (or get stolen from). The goal is passive income
(game passes, dev products, Premium Payouts, rewarded ads).

Repo: `connord138-source/hatch-and-snatch`. History was carried over from the
`hatch-and-snatch/` folder of `polymarket-scanner`; that copy is retired. It is
unrelated to the Polymarket worker.

## Decisions already made (do not re-litigate)

- **Concept:** the "Hatch & Snatch" tycoon won over survival co-op, obby and fishing ideas.
- **World:** Crackpoint Island.
  - A **Moon Egg** hangs cracked in the sky and drives the events: Blood, Gold, Void and Prism moons.
  - A Hatchery Reactor sits in the center, with a **conveyor loop** carrying eggs.
  - **8 base plots** are arranged in a ring around the loop.
  - The owner approved the loop and plot layout.
- **Art style:** inspired by *Creatures of Sonaria*, taking only the style and never its designs.
  - Semi-realistic fantasy animals with natural proportions and **realistic eyes**.
  - Faceted models with smooth shading and solid color regions.
  - Each creature is fused with a **real natural material or element**: magma, geode, coral, ice, lightning, void.
- **Approved references:**
  - **Emberlynx** (the magma lynx; a 3D model already exists).
  - **Tidalotl** (the coral axolotl).
  - **Hivebadger**.
- **Tone by rarity:** Common and Uncommon are cute or funny, Rare sits in between, Epic and above are majestic. Junk Egg creatures are pure comedy.
- **Growth, not evolution:** Baby → Juvenile → Adult, like Sonaria life stages.
- **Movement:** a slow bounding run with a hop, not a walk.
  - Babies are bouncy and clumsy, and sometimes face-plant.
  - Adults land with heavy, powerful bounds.
- **Stealing:** every stage can be stolen.
  - Carry speed goes Baby 100% → Juvenile 75% → Adult 50%.
  - "Homegrown" creatures get +25% earnings, struggle when grabbed, and can break free once.
  - Stolen creatures carry a permanent "Stolen from X" tag.
  - Each base has protected **nursery** slots for players who prefer raising their own.
- **Rarity layers:** species rarity, then genetic mutations at hatch, then **finishes** (Gold → Chrome → Diamond → Molten → Galaxy → Prismatic, plus event-only Blood Moon), then color palettes.
  - The owner loved the finish-sheet look (the toaster tortoise in 7 finishes).
- **Junk Egg:** rare and event-only, containing comic household-object creatures such as the Toaster Tortoise and Fridge Hedgehog.
- **Roster:** 30 creatures are final. See `docs/ROSTER.md` and `src/shared/Config/Creatures.luau`.

## Art direction lessons (learned the hard way)

The owner rejected all of the following:

- Generic cube or sphere creatures.
- Glossy "AI-looking" premium renders.
- A Pixar look, which doesn't translate to Roblox.
- Cartoon or anime eyes, and toy-like "cute" proportions (Kitefin, Puffleece, Crateroo, the first Cometoad).
- Too many similar lean cat or dog bodies.
- Everything standing in the **same side-on pose**.

How to prompt for concepts:

1. Use **2–3 approved creatures together** as style references, never just one; a single reference copies its body and pose. Tell the model to copy style only, not species, pose or camera.
2. Give every creature a **distinct body shape** (see the body-shape groups in `docs/ART_BIBLE.md`) and a **signature pose and silhouette**.
3. Use the neutral, legs-apart pose only for the clean model sheet sent to 3D conversion.

## Tooling notes

- **Higgsfield:** project "Hatch & Snatch — Art Tests".
  - Folder/project id `6d89dc0f-9bb7-4421-aa38-a2c3f0e1a49a`, workspace `0e9c384c-231d-44f7-92bd-b44c00f8b6ff`.
  - Concept images: `gpt_image_2_5` at 0.25 credits (low quality) or 1.5 (high quality).
  - 3D: `tripo_h3_1_image_to_3d` with face_limit 8000, about 9 credits.
- **Image files are not reachable from the sandbox.** The CloudFront download is blocked, so images can't be viewed here; only the owner sees them in the gallery. Use the job IDs in `docs/ROSTER.md` as `medias` references.
- The owner has granted **full permission** for this work, including Higgsfield spend at this scale. Don't ask for small confirmations.
- The owner prefers compact, decision-focused replies and keeping conversation context.

## Tech

- Rojo 7 (`default.project.json`) with Luau `--!strict`.
- Tool versions are pinned in `rokit.toml`; lint with selene and format with StyLua.
- Config is data-driven in `src/shared/Config/*`. New content means editing tables, not code.
- The server is authoritative for cash, hatching, growth and stealing, since stealing games attract exploiters.
- Player data: ProfileStore, vendored at `src/server/Packages` (Apache-2.0). It falls back to a mock store in unpublished Studio places.
- Services live in `src/server/Services`. The start order in `init.server.luau` matters: each service connects to `DataService.loaded` inside its `start()`, and DataService starts last.
- **Verifying from a cloud session** (no Studio available): use `rojo sourcemap`, then `luau-lsp analyze --definitions=<globalTypes.d.luau> --sourcemap=... --ignore="**/Packages/**" src`, then `stylua --check src`. Pure config and economy logic can run in the plain `luau` runtime after swapping `script.Parent.X` requires for `./X` and stubbing `Color3`.
- luau-lsp quirk: indexing `{ [Types.BiomeId]: T }` maps with values from other modules raises false singleton errors, so biome-keyed maps use `string` keys.
